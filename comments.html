<p>Take him if you can, good professor that knows his stuff. If you fail his class, drop out of CS because he's one of the best professors at CSULB for the subjects he teaches.

<p>Took him during the summer so the classes were long but Fahim makes it bearable. He gives out interesting projects and he curves if the class average is too low. He grades things late and he may seem kinda annoyed but trust the process and he really does care about his students.

<p>The professors's lectures were engaging. He also provides the powerpoint slides online. He discusses assignments in class and provides starting code. His tests and quizzes are difficult because there is a lot of new vocabulary and processes to learn. The professor may come off as intimidating or mean, but he is just joking around. He is friendly.

<p>Professor Fahim is interested in actually teaching the material. He graded on very few things but overall he was a great professor who actually took the time and effort to ensure we learned.

<p>TAKE HIM ! I honestly learn so much from him . i already took him twice and had pleasant experience on both times. you don't really have to go to class but it certainly helps if you did. I'll try to not miss a class and actually listens. he says and put emphasis on stuff that usually comes out on the exam.

<p>Fahim's lectures were alright but he often gave students a hard time if asked a question. The most frustrating part about him is his grade scale and how few things you're graded by. Not to mention he takes a long time grading papers so you won't know what your grade is until weeks after the semester is over.

<p>Professor Fahim really demonstrates his knowledge of algorithms through his lectures. This class is a very difficult topic, but I promise that this professor does what he can to help you understand it. Though it is very quiz and exam heavy, he does curve based on student performance and improvement rather than a flat grade. Would reccomend!
