<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>His lectures are like having a conversation with a professor. He's pretty chill but takes cheating very seriously. No AI and if you tab out on the quizzes he will send you to his office. Quizzes every other week plus a couple of EC assignments and for attendance. Material posted doesn't really help so being in class will give you info you need.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Solid professor, learned a lot. I highly recommend using a second device when taking his quizzes, he won't hesitate to summon you to office hours if he catches you switching tabs. Him and his TA's actively check the canvas log files to catch cheaters on his canvas quizzes.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>6 quizzes,6 PAs,2 Exams and he also gives extra credit at the end. BE VERY CAREFUL when attempting to cheat on canvas quizzes. I highly recommend you use a second device like a laptop or phone to find answers. He takes cheating very seriously as in he will summon you to office hours to plead your case. A lot of us got -1 on quizzes for tabbing out.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>The only homework was a few programming projects that can be finished in a few hours. The programming assignments cover a wild variety of things. One of them focused on maxheap and all are different programming language, some very old languages. He can go on tangents that help us more than material, but quizzes seem to be from the textbook. <div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Great professor, Attend his lecture and make sure take note. 6 assignment and 6 quiz, 1 midterm and final. So make sure do all exam and attend the quiz. His grading is base on point, each exam 100 point, so assignment and quiz matters. He also curve and give a extra credit at the end.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Chill dude, I enjoyed learning C++ from him. Remember a few important things though. Don't tab out on quizzes or exams you will get a -1 and go to the dean. If your code matches on PAs there is a decent chance he will give you a -1. He gave us 5% extra credit.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Solid professor. Provides you all the resources you need and is engaging in his lectures. Very understanding and laidback so don't hesitate to ask him anything because he is willing to listen and answer. Make sure to study because he may not go over some content fully. You do have to show up for quizzes and exams, but going to lectures is optional.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**8.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** May 24th, 2024
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Very fun professor, has 6 coding hw and 6 quizzes. While C++ might be hard at the beginning he is very helpful and open to questions. Midterm and final are based on quizzes so make sure to study those carefully and take your time analyzing each question for tricks. <div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**9.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** May 20th, 2024
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Learning C++ and Linux might be intimidating to some but luckily Professor Gold teaches it in a way that is fun and makes sense, including giving some real life examples that he has had or real life events that relates to what is being taught. The quizzes can be little tricky so be sure to read the code carefully. And yes, C++ is the best language.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**10.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 2.0 **Time:** May 18th, 2024
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Professor was funny, engaging, interactive, and helpful. Most of his content is during lectures with little powerpoint and other additional links so it's kind of important to show up. Heavy C++ with some difficult projects if not started early. Tests and Quizzes are based on lecture <div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**11.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** Apr 25th, 2024
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Great Lectures! They are not off slides, so it sometimes is hard to review so show up to class and take notes. Try to learn the basics of c++ before you start. He says its ok if you don't know in the beginning, but he doesn't really teach the syntax so it's easy to get confused the first few weeks. Exams are heavily based off quizzes!<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**12.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 4.0 **Time:** Jan 18th, 2024
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Graded by PA's, Quizzes, and Exams. PA's are manageable if you get help from TA, tutor, friends. He doesn't post much notes to study for quizzes, so study outside resources, a lot of it, to ace. He's a good prof & lecturer, but isn't always prepared. Must use vim for code and questions on quizzes, but you can code on vscode and output with wsl.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**13.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** Dec 22nd, 2023
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Steve is one of the professors in the CS department who truly stands out. Amazing lectures, great feedback, and programming assignments that allow you to digest the course's content fully. Quizzes were pretty tough as the expectation is for you to dig deeper into the concepts but they prepare you well for the exams!<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**14.** **Rating:** 5.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** May 18th, 2023
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>I recommend learning the basics of C++ before taking this course. Coding assignments and quizzes are based on previous assignments, so make sure you understand how your programs work behind the scenes. No lecture slides, Gold just shows up and starts teaching. Classes felt more like a conversation rather than a lecture, which was cool.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**15.** **Rating:** 4.0 **Difficulty:** 3.0 **Time:** May 12th, 2023
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Cool professor but lectures are freestyle which make material hard to understand. Quiz and test are not bad. <div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

###**16.** **Rating:** 4.0 **Difficulty:** 1.0 **Time:** May 7th, 2023
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>Lectures really aren't useful if you already understand C++. There isn't much Linux after the first month either. His quizzes don't really align with the lectures sometimes and the programming assignments can be done quite easily. However, he will dock your grade for any minor mistakes made on those assignments. Super cool guy who cares though.<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>
