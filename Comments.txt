Class is super easy now so ignore negative reviews. Grade is made up of at home quizzes, unlimited attempts until the due date around two weeks after a topic is covered. Final seems super easy. Lectures aren't mandatory, you'd probably be fine just reading the slides, but he is very engaging and can be pretty comedic if you decide to show up.

Had a very smooth experience taking him. Very understanding, gives great lectures, good sense of humor, and communicates very well. Highly recommend to take him.

Good at explaining the algorithms. Bad at being a real teacher.

He has changed substantially for the better While the material and concepts are hard he tries his best to make it digestible Graded by weekly quizzes that are open weeks in advance and weeks after the material has been taught Everything is open anything (except the final where he cant help you because duh) so he encourages everyone to work together

He has changed a LOT. The programs he wanted us to make were difficult since he doesn't teach how to code and you have to know how to parse big text files. Otherwise, a lot of room for error and a simple final.

That lawsuit definitely changed him LOL. His class is the easiest A ever. Grade is mostly based on weekly quizzes that is open EVERYTHING, so you can work with other people/him/whatever. All of his lectures are engaging from start to finish. The only difficult thing for me was understanding the concepts but that's kinda a skill issue on my part.

Goldstein's lectures are amazing and packed with information. He breaks down complex algorithms into simple steps for you and will guide you if you have any questions. His assignments are based on lectures and are challenging. Assignments have unlimited attempts and weeks to complete. The final exam is based on his lectures and is open notes.

This class is more about the logic of game decisions, rather than Intro to Game Programming. The class is graded 100% on quizzes, and all quizzes are unlimited tries, so free A in the class. The class itself is very interesting, but you can literally not show up, guess of the quizzes, and get your free A. He is also very knowledgeable about the mat

Do not take the professor if there are any other option, I recommend looking at different schools to take this class if possible. Goldstein falsely throws around cheating allegation without a shred of proof. The school will not protect you. Trust Me! His mental cheating system aside his class structure is bad. 5 programming assignments only 1 is ez

He accused 50+ students of plagiarism, failed them all, and then got the decision reversed a year later by the university. He flagged my original review to be taken down and he will flag your assignments as well. Reach out to a lawyer if you get failed for "pl-giarism" and it affects your academics. Just terrible
