Had a very smooth experience taking him. Very understanding, gives great lectures, good sense of humor, and communicates very well. Highly recommend to take him.

Good at explaining the algorithms. Bad at being a real teacher.

He has changed substantially for the better While the material and concepts are hard he tries his best to make it digestible Graded by weekly quizzes that are open weeks in advance and weeks after the material has been taught Everything is open anything (except the final where he cant help you because duh) so he encourages everyone to work together

He has changed a LOT. The programs he wanted us to make were difficult since he doesn't teach how to code and you have to know how to parse big text files. Otherwise, a lot of room for error and a simple final.
